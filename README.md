   [demonstration of the application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjSjc8qlI7ec1-YkYzb5vzWWE_Q61zXG/view)
  this is a README generator I made so that i dont need to manually write one for every project i make, it uses node.js and inquirer to issue a series of prompts then compiles the received information into a README.md file.
